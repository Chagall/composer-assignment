# Hugo — Composer assignment

Welcome to the Hugo Composer assignment! 
As part of our application process, we'd like to see what you can produce by giving you a small assignment. It should take you no more than a few hours to complete the assignment, but any extra polish or features you might want to put in will not go unnoticed.

## The assignment

We would like you to extend a simple text editor by adding two features to it:

 - [ ] A vowel counter. At the bottom of the composer, it should display how many vowels are present in the document and it should update dynamically as the document changes.
 - [ ] A consonant counter. Same as above but for consonants.

There's already a placeholder React component (TextStatistics.tsx) to implement the logic above. The idea is for you to focus on the task at hand rather than figuring out the boilerplate code.

#### Extra credit features

 - [ ] Tests
 - [ ] Add a word counter
 - [ ] Add rich text support (bold, italic, underline, etc)

## References

### Slate
Slate is the framework we use to allow Hugo docs in our web application. You probably will need to use [Slate's documentation](https://docs.slatejs.org) to understand how the editor works.

### How to run the project
The assignment is using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) for dependency management. So after you check out the project, run `yarn install` to install the dependencies and `yarn start` to run the project.

## Delivery
When you're finished, please follow these steps:
1) Create a Git branch named `hugo`.
2) Delete all dependencies artifacts by removing the node_modules directory.
3) Make sure your changes are committed and you are not leaving any untracked or uncommitted file or folder.
4) Zip the contents of the repository into a single zip file and upload it to Google Drive.
5) Reply in the email thread you have with Josh giving us the file URL and cc'ing `csampaio@hugo.team`.


Thanks for your time, we look forward to hearing from you!
